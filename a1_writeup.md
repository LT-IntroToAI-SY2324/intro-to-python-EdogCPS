# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
It is nice how simple it is, but also makes some coding more confusing by not reqireing certain procedures. Example: not declaing variable type when inilizing or delcaring them. It makes it ocnfusing when tracing through code.

    Initialy, I had a strong dislike agaisnt it becasue of its lack of complexity. Now, after writting a few thinkgs in the language, I feel its kinda nice. Its got a few bugs here and there but overall I enjoy coding with it.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

    python is similier in some syntax but becasue I learned Java and Javascript before this, many things seem a lot more complex then they are. I will say understanding what I google about python is easier. I still dont like the declaring varibles thing but overall thumbs up. 



3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

    How to code in python. Thanks to a good amount of chat gpt and W3 schools I now have a pretty good idea on how to do most things in python.
